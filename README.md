----------
Hi üëã 

As a data analyst at [CNIB](https://www.cnib.ca/en?region=on), a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting individuals with visual impairments, I bring a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science and over 10 years of experience in teaching coding languages and bringing data analytics to the table.

Driven by an insatiable curiosity and a solid foundation in critical thinking, my career has been centered around solving complex problems. I specialize in using SQL and Python for tasks ranging from data collection and wrangling to analysis and visualization, ensuring that insights are not only comprehensive but also accessible to all.

In summary, I offer a unique combination of technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and a dedication to serving our community. My proficiency in utilizing the Python data science software ecosystem enables me to provide valuable insights and drive meaningful change through data analysis, visualization, and effective communication.

Currently enrolled in [Data Science program](https://github.com/amanjot-git/data-science-UofT/tree/main) by University of Waterloo and University of Toronto
